## Features

- **Salesforce Integration:** Connects with an open Salesforce org to fetch data.
- **Fetch Apex Classes:** Retrieves and displays a list of all Apex classes available in the Salesforce org.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple popup UI with a button to initiate data fetch.
- **Demonstrative:** Serves as a starting point for developers looking to build Chrome extensions that work with Salesforce.

## Prerequisites

- **Google Chrome:** The extension is built for the Chrome browser.
- **Salesforce Org:** An active Salesforce org (with necessary API permissions) should be open in a tab.
- **Basic Knowledge:** Familiarity with Chrome extensions and Salesforce API concepts.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dreaminforce/sf-chrome-extension-example
   cd sf-chrome-extension-example

2. **Load the Extension in Chrome**

- Open Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions/
- Enable Developer Mode by toggling the switch in the top-right corner.
- Click Load unpacked and select the repository folder.
- Verify Host Permissions

3. The extension is pre-configured to work with Salesforce domains:

- **https://*.force.com/***
- **https://*.salesforce.com/***
- **Make sure you are logged into your Salesforce Org in an active tab.**

## Usage
- Open Salesforce
- Log in to your Salesforce Org (either in Classic or Lightning Experience).
- Activate the Extension
- Click on the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar.
- A popup will appear with a "Fetch Apex Classes" button.
- Click the Fetch Apex Classes button.
- The extension will display a list of Apex classes from your Salesforce Org.
- If no classes are found, you'll see a message indicating so. In case of errors (e.g., missing session cookie), an error message will be displayed.

## Code Overview
### manifest.json

Configures the extension with:

- Manifest version 3.
- Popup (popup.html) and background script (background.js).
- Permissions such as activeTab and cookies.
- Host permissions for Salesforce domains.

### popup.html

Provides the user interface for the extension popup, including the "Fetch Apex Classes" button and a container for displaying results.

### popup.js

Listens for the button click, sends a message to the background script, and then displays the fetched Apex classes or error messages.

### background.js

Handles the core logic:

- Determines whether the Salesforce Org is in Classic or Lightning mode.
- Retrieves the session ID (sid) from cookies.
- Constructs the appropriate API URL for Salesforce's Tooling API.
- Fetches the list of Apex classes using a SOQL query (SELECT Id, Name FROM ApexClass).


## Salesforce Integration Details

The extension connects to Salesforce by:

- **Session Detection**: Identifying whether the active tab is in Classic or Lightning mode based on the URL.
- **Cookie Retrieval**: Using Chrome's cookies API to fetch the Salesforce session ID (sid).
- **API Request**: Building the API URL and making a fetch call to Salesforceâ€™s Tooling API to retrieve Apex classes.
